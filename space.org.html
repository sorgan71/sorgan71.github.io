<h1>Welcome to Thomas Leavitt's Space.Org</h1>

A long, long, very gosh darned long time ago in a galaxy far, far, very gosh danged far away, I registered this domain while running Web Communciations, LLC, the world's first self-service web hosting company, founded in May of 1994 by myself and Chris Schefler (RIP). Since then, it has undergone a host of incarnations, but for the moment, it is basically my web playground.
